# AudioManager
The scripts I use to manage Godot audio at a global level for my games. To use this You'll need to attach the AudioManager script to a Node2D, add that as a global autoload scene, add some enum values to the SoundEffectSetting, and finally setup the SoundEffectSetting custom resouces with the correct data/settign using the export variable on the AudioManager scene.
